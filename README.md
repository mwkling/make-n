# Make-N: a number game

## Description
In this game, you start with a set of initial digits and a goal number. Your task is to combine the initial digits using different mathematical operations to reach the goal number.

Basic operations are permitted (+, -, \*, /) as well as exponents, concatenation, and 'digit splitting' (any digits from intermediate results may be split apart and recombined to make new numbers in any way).

I've written a blog post about this game here (this page also has a live version of the game): http://mikekling.com/make-n-a-number-game/

The drag and drop functionality is implemented using the [interact.js](http://interactjs.io/) library.
